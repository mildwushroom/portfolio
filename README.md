Hi there!

My name is Cristina and I'm a full-stack developer. I've come to learn that I love crafting fun and engaging designs, so I'm currently experimenting with Blender and Three.js.

My favorite technologies:
- Frontend: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Python, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

Feel free to look around, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
